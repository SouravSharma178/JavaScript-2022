<!-- ***Important point to note here is that if we want to check whether whether we clicked the confirmed button or not we will follow the procedure on line 22 -->
<!--
a major limitation of alert,prompt and confirm is that all these stop the execution of our script and unitl and unless we close the window we will not be able to interact with the script
