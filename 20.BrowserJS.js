/*
There are two ways to write JavaScript,
1.Within the html file using script tag
2.Linking the script to the html document(This method has 2 advantages,1.Separation of concerns 2.the browser stores this script file in cache memory and therefore there is no need to reload that file again again,this script file was saved in cache when it was opened the first time)
However we must note that we should write the script after the body tag and so that even if the body does not load we can still call the script successfully
